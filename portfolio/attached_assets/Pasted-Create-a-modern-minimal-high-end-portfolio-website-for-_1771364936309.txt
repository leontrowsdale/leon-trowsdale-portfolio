Create a modern, minimal, high-end portfolio website for a Mechatronic Engineering graduate targeting graduate engineering roles in robotics, automation, embedded systems, and control engineering. The design must feel technical, clean, and systems-focused — not creative agency style. Use a dark green / black / grey colour scheme. ⸻ Visual Style Requirements Primary background: #0B0F0C (deep black-green) Secondary section background: #111716 Accent colour: #1DB954 (technical green) Primary text: #E5E7EB Muted text: #9CA3AF Style should feel: • Precise • Technical • Minimal • Structured • High-end tech company aesthetic • Similar feel to Tesla, Nvidia, or a robotics startup Avoid: • Bright neon effects • Playful design • Overly animated sections • Rounded bubbly UI • Marketing-style layouts Use clean grid structure with strong alignment and generous whitespace. ⸻ Typography Headings font: Sora (semi-bold, modern, technical) Body font: Inter (clean and readable) Clear hierarchy: • Large bold H1 in hero • Medium H2 section headings • Smaller clean body text • Consistent spacing throughout ⸻ Required Pages Home Projects About Contact Navigation should be minimal, clean, and fixed at top. Include LinkedIn link in navbar and footer. Include Download CV button. ⸻ HOMEPAGE STRUCTURE Section 1: Hero Two-column layout. Left side: • Name (large H1) • Title: “Mechatronic Engineering Graduate” • One-line positioning statement: “Designing intelligent electromechanical systems integrating hardware, control, and software.” • Two buttons: • View Projects • Download CV Right side: • Clean technical image placeholder or abstract engineering graphic • Subtle fade-in animation only The hero should feel confident and minimal. ⸻ Section 2: Core Competencies Grid of 4 technical cards: Embedded Systems • Microcontrollers (Arduino / STM32 / ESP32) • C/C++ • Real-time control Modelling & Control • MATLAB / Simulink • PID control • System identification Mechanical Design • SolidWorks • FEA • Rapid prototyping Robotics & Automation • Sensors • Motor drivers • Control algorithms Cards should have: • Thin grey borders • Subtle hover elevation • Clean alignment • No heavy shadows ⸻ Section 3: Featured Projects Two-column grid layout. Each project card includes: • Project image placeholder • Project title • One-sentence technical summary • “View Case Study” link Example placeholder projects: • Self-Balancing Robot with PID Control • Automated Sorting System with Vision Integration • Embedded Motor Control System • Autonomous Line Following Robot Cards must look structured and professional. ⸻ Section 4: Engineering Philosophy Short paragraph section centered: “I approach engineering as a systems integration challenge where mechanical, electrical, and software components must function cohesively. My focus is on building reliable, testable, and scalable solutions.” Minimal styling. ⸻ PROJECT PAGE TEMPLATE Each project page should follow this case-study structure: 1. Project Overview Brief technical summary of the system. 2. The Problem Clear engineering problem definition. 3. System Architecture Include placeholder for block diagram. 4. Hardware Design Sensors, actuators, microcontroller, power system. 5. Control & Software Control strategy (PID/LQR), sampling rate, filtering, algorithms. 6. Results & Testing Performance metrics, validation, lessons learned. Layout should be clean, structured, and technical — similar to a concise engineering report. ⸻ 👤 ABOUT PAGE Sections: Professional Summary Short systems-focused summary. Technical Skills (structured list format) Education Download CV button Minimal and professional. ⸻ 📬 CONTACT PAGE Simple layout: • Email • LinkedIn • Optional contact form Dark theme consistent with rest of site. ⸻ 🧠 UX & INTERACTION REQUIREMENTS Use subtle animations only: • Fade-in on scroll • Button hover colour shift to accent green • Slight card lift on hover No parallax. No flashy transitions. No excessive motion. Responsive design required: • Mobile optimized • Grid stacks vertically on smaller screens • Text remains readable • Clean spacing on tablet and phone ⸻ Overall Tone The website should communicate: • Systems thinking • Technical competence • Engineering precision • Graduate-level professionalism • Capability in hardware + software integration It should look like a portfolio of someone ready to enter robotics, automation, or control systems engineering in industry.
